This is an example (under development) of the "Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale" (C-SSRS)" questionnaire.
Source has been: https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Suicide-Risk-Assessment-C-SSRS-Lifeline-Version-2014.pdf
(unfortunately recently removed from that website).

The example uses "matrix" style questions and repeating ItemGroups, 
and a "WorkflowDef" element to describe the workflow within the questionnaire (we will NOT use "CollectionExceptionConditionOID" for "skip questions where possible)

Remark that the example is regularly improved and updated.
