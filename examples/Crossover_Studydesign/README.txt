This is an example of a cross-over study design with epochs, arms and cells, taken from the SDTM-IG 3.3 "Example Trial 2, Crossover Trial".
The trial has 3 arms, 7 epochs, so has 3x7=21 cells, and 6 unique segments.
Remark that a cell can have more than 1 segment.
Also remark that a segment is named "trial element" in the SDTM-IG.
