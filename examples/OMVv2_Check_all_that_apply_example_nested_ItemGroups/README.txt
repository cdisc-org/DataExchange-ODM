This example is a first attempt to showcase the use of "check all that apply" groups,
with the complication that for each of these, there different values apply for "type" depending on the item.

It attempts to reconstruct the CRF "2.2.3 Example - Stroke / Lung Disease / IBD / Cancer History" on page 13
of the CDASH-UG v.1.1 (included). Also see the snapshot.

It would be great when a EDC vendor tries to reconstruct the eCRF from this example, 
in order to see whether it works as expected.
