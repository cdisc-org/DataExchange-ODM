This example demonstrates transformation from BPMN2 to CDISC-ODMv2 "Workflow"
The example is about the patient having, during a visit 1, 
the choice between getting physiotherapy, underwater therapy, or both.
After the therapy, the results are evaluated in visit 2.

The folder contains the original BPMN file (BPMN2-XML format), a snapshot picture from a BPMN viewer,
the transformation XSLT stylesheet, and the resulting ODMv2 transformation result.
