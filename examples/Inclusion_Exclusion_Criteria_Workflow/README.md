#### Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria Example

Ideally, Inclusion and Exclusion criteria are generated as a workflow. This makes it possible to have them machine-readable.
The example ODM snippet file demonstrates this as a very simple example with only 2 inclusion and only 2 exclusion criteria.
Also very complicated inclusions / exclusions, e.g. using data retrieval from EHR systems are easily possible using this methodology.
