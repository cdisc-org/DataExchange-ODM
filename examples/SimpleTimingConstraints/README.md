#### Example to demonstrate timing constraints in a workflow

This example demonstrates simple absolute, relative and transition (in a workflow) timing constraints.
The example states that the study must start between January 1, 2021 and June 31, 2021.
It also states that the study must be finalized (for each individual subject) within a year after study start, with a pardon period of one month.
It defines a simple workflow with a study start, study end and two visits, with some transition timing constraints between them.
