The XSLT stylesheet allows to transform an ODM v.1.3.x study design into an ODM v.2 study design,
in which a workflow ("WorkflowDef" element) for all "scheduled" StudyEvents is generated.
The result workflow is a simple linear workflow, with the order as defined in the "Protocol" element of the source ODM v.1.3.x file.
