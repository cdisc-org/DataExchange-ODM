# LZZTV2
The LZZTV2 example is an adaptation of the LZZTTrialexample.xml provided with the SDM-XML download.  

The example is rooted in the CDISC Pilot Project and based on an Alzheimers' study that was operated and eventually cancelled by Eli Lilly.  While some of the content is somewhat dated from the 2020 persective, it nonetheless is a representation of how CDISC standards could be used for a reasonably complex real-life study.

This example was adapted in order to experiment with the SDM workflow features included in ODM Version 2.0.   Specifically, it is aimed at investigating whether the PARS3 requirements can be accommodated within ODM Version 2.  Some sections of the original example have been simplified. There are some comments in the example.
