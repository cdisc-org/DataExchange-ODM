Please visit the Operational Data Model (ODM) page on the CDISC web site for more information about ODM1-3-2 <http://www.cdisc.org/odm>.

This is version 1.3.2 of the ODM, which replaces 1.3.1.  In the specification document (ODM1-3-2-Final.html) section "2.5 Changes from Previous Versions" provides a summary of the new features added in this release. Detailed descriptions of the new features have been incorporated into the text of the specification document. ODM Version 1.3.2 has been designed to provide backward compatibility with previous versions of the model in most cases, and is completely backward compatible with ODM 1.3.1. In cases where backward compatibility has been impacted, it is due to clarifying the specification to more completely match the original intent of the standard. 

The document ODM131-132-xsd-diff.htm shows the detailed differences between the ODM 1.3.1 foundation schema (ODM1-3-1-foundation.xsd) and the ODM 1.3.2 foundation schema (ODM1-3-2-foundation.xsd). 

ODM 1.3.2. has the same namespace as 1.3.1. Use ODMVersion to indicate the version used. ODMVersion is enumerated and the list of options is shown in the specification.

ODM is a vendor neutral, platform independent format for interchange and archive of clinical study data. The model includes the clinical data along with its associated metadata, administrative data, reference data and audit information. All of the information that needs to be shared among different software systems during the setup, operation, analysis, submission or for long term retention as part of an archive is included in the model.
