<h2><a name="toc0">Introduction (Commentary)</h2>

<p>The Operational Data Model (ODM) provides a format for representing the
study metadata, study data and administrative data associated with a
clinical trial. It represents only the data that would be transferred among
different software systems during a trial, or archived after a trial. It
need not represent any information internal to a single system, for
example, information about how the data would be stored in a particular
database.

<p>An attempt has been made to make the format system-neutral. We have
therefore attempted to avoid terminology that might be perceived as
associated with a single system. Some of the terms in the model might
therefore seem unfamiliar, and will be explained as various parts of the
model are presented.

<p>Clinical data management systems vary significantly in the information
they store and the rules they enforce.  If the ODM model were restricted to
only those features common to all clinical systems, the resulting model
would be close to useless.  The capabilities of the most primitive known
Clinical Data Management System (CDMS) would limit all other systems.
For example,
<ol>
<li> Not all CDMSs currently support electronic signatures, so the "features
common to all" approach would exclude electronic signatures from ODM.  Even
if most systems support electronic signatures, they could not use ODM to
transfer them!
<li> The same problem arises when using ODM to archive a study.  It is not
reasonable to prevent a CDMS from archiving information just because some
other system cannot fully handle all the archived information.
</ol>
Consequently, the ODM model has been designed to represent a wide range of
study information.  It should be understood that not all systems will be
able to handle every part of the model.

<p>Version 1.1 of the ODM model explicitly does not address the following
issues:
<ol>
<li> Communications mechanisms and the reliability of communications.
<li> Real-time coordination of multiple CDMSs.
<li> Description of data collection systems, including issues 
of screen layout, editing, complete data checking, and data cleaning.
<li> Investigator/sponsor interactions, including data queries.
</ol>

<h2><a name="toc1">General Issues</h2>

<h3><a name="toc2">Content of the Standard</h3>

<p>This document contains the entire CDISC ODM standard.  Most of the text
in this standard expresses requirements on systems that read or write ODM
files.  However some of the text is commentary or examples.  All such
non-normative text is segregated into paragraphs or sections prominently
marked as Commentary</b>, a Note</b>, or an Example</b>.

<h3><a name="toc3">File Conformity</h3>

<p>An XML file conforms to this standard only if it satisfies all the
criteria detailed in this standard.  These criteria include both syntactic
constraints and semantic ones.

<p>The syntactic constraints are
<ol>
<li> The ODM file must be a well-formed XML file.  See
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml">the XML standard</a> for details.
<li> The ODM file must contain only elements and attributes defined in this
standard, and satisfy the rules about element nesting and the formats of
attribute values and element bodies.
<li> The ODM file must contain a prolog, a document type declaration, and
a single (top-level) <a href=#ODM>ODM element</a>.
<li> The XML system identifier for the version 1.1 ODM file format is
"http://www.cdisc.org/dtd/odm1-1-0.dtd".
</ol>

<p>Example:</b> <br>
<table><tr><td><td>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?&gt;<br>
&lt;!DOCTYPE ODM SYSTEM "http://www.cdisc.org/dtd/odm1-1-0.dtd"&gt;<br>
&lt;ODM ...&gt;<br>
 ...<br>
&lt;/ODM&gt;
</table>
<p>The semantic constraints are expressed throughout the rest of this
document.

<p>Accompanying this standard is an automatically generated DTD file which
expresses certain of the syntactic constraints.  This DTD can be used (along
with a validating XML parser) to test that an ODM file is syntactically
valid.  However, syntactic validity is only part of total correctness.

<h3><a name="toc4">System Conformity</h3>

<p>A computing system that processes information in ODM format can claim
conformance to this standard only if it obeys the following rules.
<ol>
<li> Generated ODM files must satisfy all the correctness rules in this
standard, both syntactic and semantic.
<li> A receiving system must be able to read any ODM file that satisfies all
the correctness rules in this standard, both syntactic and semantic.
<li> Information included in generated ODM files must be accurate according
to the rules of this standard.
<li> A receiving system must interpret information read from an ODM file
accurately according to the rules of this standard.
<li> Generated ODM files need not include information that is not normally
handled or stored by the generating system.
<li> A receiving system may selectively ignore information read from an ODM
file if that information is not normally handled or stored by the receiving
system.
<li> A receiving system may constrain the range of data values, keys, names,
and so on, that it is capable of handling or storing.
<li> All system limitations (rules 5 thru 7) must be documented.
<li> If conformity is dependent on certain modes or settings, this must also
be documented.
</ol>

<h3><a name="toc5">Vendor Extensions</h3>

<p>Clinical data systems frequently store more information than can be
expressed in the ODM model.  The exact nature of such additional information
will vary from system to system.  Thus, there will be pressure for
proprietary extensions to the model.

<p>Vendor extensions to the ODM model are acceptable as long as
<ol>
<li> The vendor supplies a XML DTD specification fully describing their
extended ODM format.
<li> Extended ODM files reference the proper extension DTD.
<li> The extension adds new XML elements and attributes, but does not render
any standard ODM file obsolete.  That is, all ODM files that are correct
under this standard are acceptable as extended ODM files.
<li> All new element and attribute names use <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml-names">XML namespaces</a> to insure that
there are no naming conflicts with other vendor extensions.
<li> The file obtained (from an extended ODM file) by removing all vendor
extensions must be a meaningful and accurate standard ODM file.
<li> ODM files free of any vendor extensions can be generated upon request.
</ol>

<p>Vendor extensions should never be used for information that can be
expressed using other ODM elements.

<p>Vendor extensions that carry generally useful information should be
brought to CDISC's attention for possible future standardization.

<p>Note:</b> It is easy to write a filter that removes all non-standard attributes
and elements from an extended XML file, either as a stand-alone program or
as part of normal input processing.  Receiving systems are encouraged to be
forgiving when encountering extended ODM files.

<h3><a name="toc6">Entities and Elements</h3>

<p>The ODM model assumes that a study's clinical data will consist of
several kinds of entities.  These include subjects, study events, forms,
item groups, items, and annotations.

<p>An <em>item</em> is an individual clinical data item, such as a single
systolic blood pressure reading.  Items are collected together into item
groups.

<p>An <em>item group</em> is a closely related set of items that are
generally analyzed together.  (Item groups are sometimes referred to as
"records" and are associated with "panels" or "tables".)  Item groups are
aggregated into forms.

<p>A <em>form</em> is analogous to a page in a paper CRF book or electronic
CRF screen.  A form generally collects a set of logically and temporally
related information.  A series of forms is collected as part of a study
event.

<p>A <em>study event</em> is a patient visit or some other data-collection
event.  Each study event belongs to some patient in the study.

<p>An <em>annotation</em> is a comment applied to a subject, study event, form,
item group, or item.

<p>The metadata of a study describes the types of study events, forms, item
groups, and items that are allowed in the study.  Each
<em>StudyEventDef</em> describes a particular type of study event (mostly by
listing the types of forms it can contain).  Each <em>FormDef</em> describes
a particular type of form, each <em>ItemGroupDef</em> describes a particular
type of item group, and each <em>ItemDef</em> describes a particular type of
item.

<p>The clinical data of a study will typically have many actual study
events corresponding to each StudyEventDef, many actual forms corresponding
to each FormDef, and so on.

<p>The clinical data elements in an ODM file represent either the state of a
clinical entity or a change to the state of that entity.  These include the
<em>SubjectData</em>, <em>StudyEventData</em>, <em>FormData</em>,
<em>ItemGroupData</em>, <em>ItemData</em> and <em>Annotation</em> elements.
Each such element contains key attributes that identify the data entity that
it provides information for.  Frequently, many data elements will correspond
to a single data entity.  This occurs when a series of updates are being
applied to a single entity, or when an audit trail is being represented.

<h3><a name="toc7">Element Identifiers</h3>

<p>Many ODM elements have OID attributes.  OID attribute values are used (by
other elements) to reference the original elements.  This is particularly
true of metadata elements.

<p>All OID attribute values must be unique within some set of elements,
either within a single ODM file, or within a series of ODM files.  The
following table describes these uniqueness requirements.

<p><table>
<tr><td><td>Element with OID </b>
<td>Scope of Uniqueness</b><td>
<tr><td><td>Study<td>within a series of files
<tr><td><td>User<td>within a series of files
<tr><td><td>Location<td>within a series of files
<tr><td><td>SignatureDef<td>within a series of files
<tr><td><td>MeasurementUnit<td>within the containing Study
<tr><td><td>MetaDataVersion<td>within the containing Study
<tr><td><td>StudyEventDef<td>within the containing MetaDataVersion
<tr><td><td>FormDef<td>within the containing MetaDataVersion
<tr><td><td>ItemGroupDef<td>within the containing MetaDataVersion
<tr><td><td>ItemDef<td>within the containing MetaDataVersion
<tr><td><td>CodeList<td>within the containing MetaDataVersion
<tr><td><td>Presentation<td>within the containing MetaDataVersion
<tr><td><td>ArchiveLayout<td>within the containing FormDef
</table>

<h3><a name="toc8">Clinical Data Keys</h3>

<p>There are two kinds of keys in the ODM model: <em>internal</em> and
<em>external</em>.  Internal keys are used to designate entities within the
model, and to allow cross-references between entities within (and between)
ODM files.  Internal keys are not for human use, and are assumed to be
unchanging.  Internal keys include subject keys, element IDs, and repeat
keys.

<p>To fully identify a clinical data entity, the following internal keys
are needed:

<p><table>
<tr><td><td>Kind of Entity </b>
<td>Identifying Keys</b><td>
<tr><td><td>study<td>StudyID
<tr><td><td>subject<td>above plus SubjectKey
<tr><td><td>study event<td>above plus StudyEventOID and StudyEventRepeatKey
<tr><td><td>form<td>above plus FormOID and FormRepeatKey
<tr><td><td>item group<td>above plus ItemGroupOID and ItemGroupRepeatKey
<tr><td><td>item<td>above plus ItemID
<tr><td><td>annotation<td>keys for the annotated entity plus SeqNum
</table>

<p>External keys are those used by clinical personnel.  These include
subject randomization codes, site codes, and so on.  In the ODM model,
external keys are represented as if they were clinical data.  Thus external
keys can be changed as needed, and are subject to normal auditing processes.

<a name="ODM Document Attributes"></a><h3><a name="toc9">ODM Document Attributes</h3>
<!-- start ODM Document Attributes -->
<p>Each ODM document is a set of instructions telling how to modify a target
database so that it can be brought into alignment with a source database.
Most individual ODM documents will contain only part of the total current plus
historical information held in the source database.
<p>The information that is sent in a given document can vary in several 
dimensions. Some examples
of the contents of a document are:
<ul>
<li>
just metadata</li>

<li>
just clincial data.</li>

<li>
a series of updates of a single value for a single subject.</li>

<li>
the current state of the entire study,</li>

<li>
the current state of a subset of a study (particular subjects, particular
forms, etc)</li>

<li>
changes to the study since the last communication</li>

<li>
a full history of all changes ever made to the study.</li>
</ul>
The result is that, over a series of documents that describe a study, there
will be a necessary time ordering in which the documents must be processed.
It is also important that each document describe itself, so that the consumer
of the document knows what to expect in it. To address these needs, the
ODM element has several attributes for describing the document.
<p>The AsOfDateTime provide information that anchors the document in the source
database's life history, and PriorFileOID gives a mechanism for ensuring
that a sequence of documents that include dependencies is complete and
in order (see FileOIDs and Filenames for a discussion of ways in which you can identify a 
file, given its FileOID). The attributes FileType and Granularity allow the document sender
to define the scope, across time and data, respectively, that a particular
document spans. The Archive attribute allows the sender to assert that the 
contents of the document meet a specific set of criteria that qualifies it as
an electronic record as defined in the FDA 21 CFR 11 Guidance. 
Finally, the Description attribute provides the sender
a text string in which to give details, as elaborately as necessary, to
supplement the other atttributes in describing the document. This
section details the values these attribute can take, and discusses the
use of the values in a single document and in a series of documents.
<p><i>Note:</i> Any ODM-compliant transmission can describe one or more
studies. To simplify the discussion in this section, we will assume that
the transmission only describes one study. If your transmission describes
multiple studies, apply the rules discussed here in turn to each of the
studies included in the transmission.
<p>A stream of documents is a series of documents where the PriorFileOID
links each document to its predecessor. A document with PriorFileOID set
to the null string ("") is the initiator of a stream. Data sent in one
file in a stream is allowed to depend on definitions, and earlier transactions
about the data, that were send in an earlier file in the stream.
If a file contains either ReferenceData or ClinicalData then that file
must either contain the necessary metadata definitions to interpret that
data directly, or there must be a predecessor file in the stream that contains
these definitions. Similarly, if a file contains ClinicalData (regardless
of granularity), the file must either contain the admin data referenced
in the audit/signature records, or there must be a predecessor in the stream
that contain these definitions.

<p><u>Filetype</u><br>A document's FileType must be either Snapshot or Transactional.
A Snapshot shows how to re-create the current state of the
source database with respect to the included data, but does not show how
it got to be in that state over time. A Transactional document shows, for each
included entity, both the latest state of the source database, and (optionally)
some prior states of that entity in the source database. A Snapshot document
contains only Insert transactions for clinical data, and must contain exactly
one Insert instruction per data point, while a Transactional document may contain
more that one TransactionType instruction, of any type, per clinical data
element. When you process an Transactional document, the rules for ordering a set
of transactions for a single data point are those described in the section
on <a href="#Element Ordering">Element Ordering</a>.
<p><a name="Granularity values">
<p><u>Granularity</u><br>
Granularity is intended to give the sender a shorthand way to describe
the breadth of the information in the document, for certain common types
of documents. Here are the intended meanings of these categories:
<br>
<table BORDER >
<tr>
<td>All</td>

<td>Can contain any or all data &amp; metadata types</td>
</tr>

<tr>

<p><u>Archival</u><br>
The ODM attribute Archival is optional. If you set it for a document, its
value must be "Yes". Here is how Archival=Yes is interpreted. 

The intent of this attribute is to indicate that the file is intended to meet
the requirements of an electronic record as defined in 21 CFR 11.  More
generally, the file (or set of files) must clearly establish a complete and 
non-redundant set of entries, updates or deletes (transactions) to data values,
where each transaction is associated with signature information and any changes
or deletions are marked with a reason for change. 

Specifications (assertions) for the case when Archival=Yes.

<ol>
<li>
The file must have FileType=Transactional.
</li> 
<li>
It can apply to either a single file (where PriorFileID is null) or to a 
linked series  of files, in which case all files in the series
must be both Transactional and Archival.  
</li>
<li>
The set of transactions must be both complete and non-redundant within the file
(if it’s a single file) or within a series of linked files.  In particular each
file in series must:
<ul>
	    <li>
            contain no transactions that have an audit date of prior to the 
	    AsOfDateTime of its PriorFile (if any).
            </li><li>
            must contain all transactions up to its AsOfDateTime. For 
	    Granularity=All, 
	    this means all transactions in the study. 
	    See <a href="#ODM">ODM</a> and <a href="#Granularity values">
	    Granularity</a> for the meaning of "all" for other 
	    Granularity settings.  
            </li><li>

<p><a NAME="Metadata underpinnings of Reference and Subject transfers"></a>
<h3><a name="toc10">Metadata underpinnings of Reference and Subject transfers</h3>
<p>Under ODM, the definition of an entity and an instance of its use are
tied together by unique identification numbers. For instance, when you
define an ItemDef in an ODM transmission, you are required to provide a
value for its identifier attribute (OID) that is unique with respect to
all other ItemDefs in the study . Then, when you send a transmission concerning
a particular ItemData instance, you refer back to the item's definition
by setting the ItemData's identifer reference attribute (ItemOID) value
to that of the corresponding ItemDef. Definitions occur in the Admin and
Study elements (these are the elements included in Metadata transmissions).
References occur within all of the base elements of an ODM document: Admin,
Study, ReferenceData, and ClinicalData.
<p>ODM permits you to place the definition in one document within a stream,
and a reference to the definition in a subsequent document. (This, incidentally,
is why identifier and reference attributes have the XML attribute value
of CDATA rather than ID and IDREF; XML supports ID and IDREF only within
a single XML document. To highlight this, ODM identifier attributes use
the string <i>OID</i> instead of <i>ID</i>). A benefit of this is that
you do not have to include all of the metadata in each transmission of
data. The cost is that you cannot depend on the XML parser to detect that
an IDREF does not have a corresponding ID within a given transaction. Therefore
the sender must follow (and recipient should check against) these rules:
<blockquote>You cannot send a reference to an OID value unless that OID
value has been defined, either in the current document, or in a prior document
within the stream.
<p>If a definition identified by an OID has changed, the change in its
definition must be transmitted before or in the document in which the changed
definition is referenced.</blockquote>
Here are some corollaries to these rules:
<ul>
<li>
A document that initiates a stream must contain all definitions
that it references.</li>

<li>
A Transactional document must include any supporting definitions that are
new or changed relative to its stream. For example, suppose that document
B3207 includes references to item X, and that the name of the codelist
for X has changed since its predecessor document. In that case, theB3207
must also include a Study/MetaDataVersion element with an new OID, and
an instruction to update the definition of item X.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<!-- end ODM Document Attributes -->

<h3><a name="toc11">Transactions</h3>
<p>Each data element has an
optional TransactionType attribute.  This attribute can be one of
<em>Insert</em>, <em>Update</em>, <em>Remove</em>, or <em>Upsert</em>.

<p>A TransactionType of Insert means that the data entity is new (does not
currently exist in the study) and must be added to the study data along with
all the properties provided.  It is an error if the data entity already
exists, or if the data entity's parent does not exist.

<p>A TransactionType of Update means that the data entity already exists
and must be modified to have the new properties provided.  Properties not
mentioned are not modified.  It is an error if the data entity does not
exist.

<p>A TransactionType of Remove means that the data entity already exists
and must be deleted along with all its properties and children.
It is an error if the data entity does not exist.

<p>Note:</b> The use of the word "delete" does not imply that all record of the
data entity is expunged, just that the data entity is not visible through
the ODM model.

<p>A TransactionType of Upsert is the same as Update if the data entity
exists, and the same as Insert otherwise.

<p>Note:</b> Upsert allows the sender to ignore whether the data entity exists or
not. (A capability that may be needed by certain data collection systems.)
This capability is potentially dangerous and may be removed in future
versions of this standard.

<p> A TransactionType of Context means that the data is explicitly being resent for 
context purposes only. An example of this would be sending an ItemGroup containing
demographic data every time (with a TransactionType of Context) to permit matching
and checking of Patient IDs between the sender and receiver systems.

<p>A child element that does not specify its own TransactionType inherits the
TransactionType of its parent.  The TransactionType of the top level data
element (SubjectData) must be explicit for Archive and Incremental transfers.

<p>Transaction processing proceeds in the order in which data elements
appear in the ODM document. If two transactions for an entity are included in an ODM
document, they are applied in the order in which they appear.

<p>If an entity has a TransactionType of Remove, the only TransactionType its
descendants can have is Remove (they can also have no TransactionType, and thus
inherit the Remove type). A program that processes ODM files should look ahead
far enough to determine if an element breaks this rule before processing the
element.

<a name="Element Ordering"></a><h3><a name="toc12">Element Ordering</h3>

<p>The elements in an ODM file that apply to a single entity must occur in
temporal order.  That is, the transactions on each entity are applied in the
order in which that entity's elements occur in the file, and Signatures and
AuditRecords must occur in increasing value of their DateTimeStamps.

<p>In general, the elements for distinct entities do not have to be ordered
relative to one another.  However, when an entity is signed, all
transactions on that entity that occured before the time of the signature
must be present earlier in the same ODM file or in a prior ODM file in a
linked series.

<p>All the DateTimeStamps in a file must precede the CreationDateTime of
that file.

<p>In a linked series of ODM files, the AsOfDateTimes of those files
must occur in temporal order, and the DateTimeStamps in each file must be
later than the AsOfDateTimes of the prior file.

<p>A data entity (like a form) can be represented as a series of data
elements.  These elements can contain data for disjoint parts of the entity
(properties and children), sequential changes to the same parts, or a
mixture of the two.

<p>In a study, the initial or default value of any clinical data is assumed
to be NULL.  Thus it is not necessary to include NULL valued items in a
Snapshot transfer.  Neither is it necessary to include a NULL value as the
first in a series of insertions and updates of an item.

<p>Systems that generate ODM files should attempt to minimize the number of
elements in such files.  Thus, if two elements for the same entity can be
merged into one without changing the semantics of the events described (and
without violating any of the ordering rules), the merged version is
recommended.  Similarly, unnecessary elements should be omitted.

<a name="FileOIDs and Filenames"/><h3><a name="toc13">FileOIDs and Filenames</h3>
<p>Note: this section discusses a recommendation, rather than a normative requirement.

<p>In a linked series of ODM files, each file identifies itself uniquely (in the
root <a href="#ODM">ODM</a> element) with its FileOID attribute, and the file
points to its predecessor through its PriorFileOID</a> attribute, which names
the FileOID of its predecessor.  There is no necessary connection between the
FileOID and filename. However, defining a mapping between them can make it
easier to locate a file's predecessors. For example, suppose you have received
two files, named a.xml and b.xml, and a.xml has FileOID=1, and b.xml has
FileOID=2, and PriorFileOID=1.  Knowing b.xml's PriorFileOID does not tell you
what file to look in to access the predecessor document. If, on the other hand,
you adopted a convention that filename is the same as FileOID, then looking up
predecessors becomes easier. 

<h3><a name="toc14">Syntax Notation</h3>

<p>Each XML element is defined as follows:

<p><table><tr><td><td>
<h3>Element-Name</h3>
Body:<br>
 <table><tr><td><td>
<em>content-specification</em>
 </table>
<br>
Attributes:<br>
 <table><tr><td><td>
<em>attribute-name</em> <em>data-format</em>
 <em>optionality</em> <em>semantic-details</em><br>
 ...</b>
 </table>
</table>
<p>The content specification can be "EMPTY", a data format name, or an
element group.  EMPTY means that this element has no body
(nested content).  A data format name means that the body can be any text
string matching the named format.  An element group means that the named
elements can be directly nested within this element.

<p>An element group consists of one or more element names (or element
groups) enclosed in parentheses, and separated with commas or vertical bars.
Commas indicate that the elements (or element groups) must occur in the XML
sequentially in the order listed in the group.  Vertical bars indicate that
exactly one of the elements (or element groups) must occur.  An element or
element group can be followed by a ?  (meaning optional), a * (meaning zero
or more occurrances), or a + (meaning one or more occurrances).

<p>Attributes are listed in tabular form, one attribute per row, including
the attribute's name, its data format, its optionality, and possibly some
semantic details.  All attributes are required unless the optionality column
contains "<em>(optional)</em>".

<h3><a name="toc15">Data Formats</h3>

<p>All attribute values and some element bodies are text strings.  These
strings are defined by data format.  Each data format specifies the
allowable form of the string, the corresponding XML datatype, and the
intended use of the value.  The ODM data formats are

<p>Numbers (<em>integer</em> and <em>float</em>) are represented in base
10. Floats are allowed to have fractional parts.

<p>A <em>text</em> value is any sequence of
<a href="http://www.unicode.org/unicode/standard/standard.html">Unicode</a> characters.  When embedded in
ODM files, text strings must be represented using XML quoting rules.

<p><em>Dates</em> are represented in the Gregorian calendar.  The year
(YYYY) ranges from 0001 to 9999.  The month (MM) ranges from 01 to 12.  The
day (DD) ranges from 01 to 31.

<p><em>Times</em> are clock readings within a 24 hour period.  The hour (hh)
ranges from 00 to 23.  The minutes (mm) and the seconds (ss) range from 00
to 59.  The optional fractional part (.nnn) expresses milliseconds.

<p><em>Dates</em>, <em>times</em>, and <em>datetimes</em> are to be
interpreted as local clock readings at the place the data was collected.  In
a datetime, the +hh:mm (or -hh:mm) is the offset in hours and minutes to add
to (or subtract from) Universal Time to get the local clock reading at the
time the data was collected.  A special offset of -99:99 means that the
relationship between the local clock and Universal Time is not known.

<p>Example:</b> 3:14 pm on 3 January 2001 in Chicago (6 timezones west of
Greenwich, standard time) would be represented as
"2001-01-03T15:14:00-06:00".  3.5 seconds after midnight on the morning of
July 20th 2001 in Chicago (daylight time) would be represented as
"2001-07-20T00:00:03.500-05:00".

<p>Note:</b> The above formats for <em>dates</em>, <em>times</em>, and
<em>datetimes</em> are compatible with <a href="http://xml.coverpages.org/ISO-FDIS-8601.pdf">ISO 8601</a>
except for the use of the -99:99 offset.

<p>An <em>id</em> or <em>idref</em> can be 1 to 100 characters long.  An
OID is a string that uniquely identifies an element within an ODM file.
Metadata elements must have ids unique within their MetaDataVersion.  The
term "idref" denotes the use of an OID to reference an element (as opposed to
the defining occurrence of that id).

<p>The <em>value</em> format is simply the union of all the preceding formats:
integer, float, date, time, datetime, text, id, idref.  The value format is
used when the specific value type is determined by metadata rather than by the
immediately containing element.

<p>A <em>subjectKey</em> or <em>repeatKey</em> can be 1 to 100 characters
long.

<p>A <em>name</em> is intended to be a human readable name for some entity.
Names can be 1 to 100 characters long.

<p>A <em>sasName</em> is any valid SAS Version 5 name. SAS names cannot
start with a digit, and are 1 to 8 characters long.

<p>A <em>fileName</em> can be 1 to 100 characters long.  File names are
system dependent, and expressed relative to the directory that contains the
ODM file being processed.

<p>A <em>languageTag</em> represents a natural language or a
country-specific variant of a natural language. The allowed values are
specified in <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3066.txt">IETF RFC 3066: Tags for the
Identification of Languages</a>.

<p>Example:</b> "fr-CA" denotes the French language, Canadian variant.
See <a href=#TranslatedText>TranslatedText</a> for a discussion of how
languageTags are used.

<p>In general, if you want to represent a NULL attribute value for any of these
formats, use an empty string (e.g., attribute-name=""). To represent a NULL for
data transmitted in an element body, send the element as empty (e.g.
<element-name/>). There is a special IsNull indicator for clinical data, to
differentiate between the case where there is no known value, and the case
where you want to replace a value with NULL. See the IsNull attribute of the 
<a href="#ItemData">ItemData</a> element.

<h2><a name="toc17">Metadata Elements</h2>

The metadata for a study is defined in a series of MetaDataVersion
elements. Through this mechanism (multiple MetaDataVersion elements), the
model supports the incremental deployment of "mid-study changes", and thus
can handle a situation where multiple versions of the metadata are being
used simultaneously (perhaps due to delays in IRB approval at various
sites).

<p>The way metadata versioning works is as follows.  An individual Study
element may contain multiple MetaDataVersions, reflecting one or more
mid-stream study design changes. The initial version contains a full set of
metadata.  Each subsequent version typically contains only modified or newly
added metadata elements, inheriting the previous metadata by a explicit
reference.  The same metadata elements in different versions will have the
same ID. This approach is used to allow the older versions of the metadata
to remain intact, while simultaneously providing a concise way to represent
changes.

A metadata version defines the types of study events, forms, item groups, and
items that form the study data.

<p>The Include element references a prior metadata version.  This causes all
the definitions in that prior metadata version to be included in this one.
Any of the included definitions can be replaced (overridden) by explicitly
giving a new version of the definition (with the same ID) in the new
metadata version.  New definitions (with new IDs) can be added in the same
way.

<p>Note:</b> The current metadata model does not include any scheduling
information such as the time ordering of events, the spacing of events,
conditional occurrence of events, and so on.  The analogous information for
forms is also not included.  Future versions of this standard will probably
provide such information.

A StudyEventDef describes a type of study event that takes place during a
study.  A scheduled event is one that is expected to occur for each subject
as part of the ordinary progress of the study.  An unscheduled event is not
expected to occur, but may occur as circumstance dictates.  Scheduled and
unscheduled events typically occur at some particular time.  A common event
collects data forms, but is not expected to be associated with a particular
time.

<p>The Repeating flag indicates that this type of study event can occur
repeatedly within the containing study.

<p>The Category attribute is typically used to indicate the study phase
appropriate to this type of study event.  Examples might include Screening,
PreTreatment, Treatment, and FollowUp.

<p>
An ItemDef describes a type of item that can occur within a study.  Item
properties include name, datatype, data size, measurement units, range or
codelist restrictions, and several other properties.

<p>The DataType attribute specifies how the corresponding Value elements
are to be interpreted for comparison and storage.  The Length attribute is
required when DataType is integer, float, or text (and can be ignored for the
other datatypes).  The SignificantDigits attribute is
required when DataType is float (and can be ignored for the
other datatypes).

<p>If DataType=integer, Length=N is a requirement that the receiving system
be able to process and store all whole number values of magnitude less than
10<sup>N</sup>.  Larger values may be rejected.

<p>If DataType=float, Length=N and SignificantDigits=S is a requirement
that the receiving system be able to process and store all numeric values of
magnitude less than 10<sup>N-S</sup> that are multiples of 10<sup>-S</sup>.
Larger values may be rejected.  Intermediate values may be rounded to the
nearest multiple of 10<sup>-S</sup>.

<p>If DataType=text, Length=N is a requirement that the receiving system
be able to process and store all text string values of length less than or
equal to N.  All <a href="http://www.unicode.org/unicode/standard/standard.html">Unicode</a> characters are
allowed in text string values.

<p>Note:</b> Length and SignificantDigits are statements about an item's
data values, not the number of characters used to represent these values in
Value elements.  For example, the character "&lt;" might be represented as
"&amp;lt;".

<p>Note:</b> Data characters that are not included in the encoding character set
for a particular ODM file must be represented using XML entities or
character references.  For example, &#198; could be represented as
"&amp;#198;".

<p> The Origin, Role, and Comment attributes carry submission information as
described in the <a href="http://www.cdisc.org/models/sds/v2.0/index.html">CDISC Submission Metadata Model</a>.

<p>Note:</b> <u>SDSVarName attribute</u>
<p> In ODM 1.1 we define all OID values (such as SubjectID) as specifically
being internal, unchangeable values. This was done to make the audit
trail issues work: if the SubjectOID in the model were the actual external
subject identifier (or randomization ID) of a patient and that value is sent
incorrectly in one transmission, there would be no way to correct the
mistake in a followup transition. In doing this we intend that the
external subject keys (and other study key variables) should be defined
as Items in the metadata and then can be modified through the ODM audit
trail. While this solves the problem of supporting modifications of
study keys, it left you without a way to identify which ItemDefs have
special meaning or what the meaning is. The most obvious place where
this is a problem is in matching up patients when loading data from an
external source. If you can't find the patient id how do you do it? 

<p>The answer is to use the SDSVarname attribute of ItemDef.
SDSVarName is an optional attribute of an Item Definition which
you can use to tag the Item with a business meaning. Rather than try
to enumerate all possible meanings in the ODM model, the ODM working 
group thought it best to rely on the set of variable names defined in
the Submissions Data Model (version 2.0), since this list covers most 
core variables used in managing clinical data.
Software that is processing an ODM-compliant XML instance can therefore 
check for specific values of the SDSVarName
variable to search for standard, frequently used variables. The use of
this attribute is restricted to a variable defined in the SDS V2.0
model, and in tagging a variable, you are identifying it as being
properly defined by the SDS V2.0 definition for that variable. A partial
list of commonly used values includes: 
<ul>
<li>SITEID (Center or Site ID), 
<li>SUBJID (Subject ID, usually the Randomization ID), 
<li>SCSUBJID (Screening SubjectID) 
<li>SEX (Sex or Gender, coded value), 
<li>VISIT (visit name), 
<li>DMACTDT (actual date of visit) 
<li>DMREFDT (subject reference date) 
<li>BIRTHDT (date of birth), 
<li>SUBJINIT (subject initials) 
</ul>
<br>
<p>See the SDS V2.0 definition for definitions and additional choices. 

<p>Note:</b> The Question element describes the purpose of the item for a human
user.  The ExternalQuestion element does the same but refers to an externally
defined question.  If both are present, they should be consistent.

<p>The MeasurementUnitRefs list the acceptable measurement units for this
type of item.  Only numeric (integer or float) items should have measurement
units.  If only one MeasurementUnitRef is present, all items of this type
carry this measurement unit by default.  If no MeasurementUnitRef is
present, the item's value is scalar (i.e., a pure number).

<p>The RangeChecks constrain the acceptable values for items of this type.

<p>The CodeListRef (if present) constrains the acceptable values for items
of this type to be members of the referenced codelist.

<p>Note:</b> Items do not repeat within an item group.

Information about a specific user of a clinical data collection system.

<!-- ***GEG COMMENT***The user may be optionally assigned a UserType.  While there are 
a significant number of possible user types that could be assigned, the ODM team
agreed that for the purpose of transferring or archiving study data, the fact that
a user works for either the Sponsor, the Investigator, a Lab are the primary 
distinctions that matter.  We decided it was better to have narrowly constrained list
of possibilities for this choice than to leave it open as CDATA. *** END GEG COMMENT*** -->

Reference data provides information on how to interpret clinical data.  For
example, reference data might include lab normal ranges.  Signature elements
nested within ReferenceData have no meaning, and should be ignored.

<p>The StudyOID and MetaDataVersionOID attributes select a particular metadata
version.  All metadata references (IDs) occuring within this ReferenceData
element refer to definitions within the selected metadata version.

<p>The TransactionType attribute behaves the same within ReferenceData as
it does within ClinicalData.

<p>Note:</b> Since reference data can be independent of any particular study, it
may be desirable to keep the reference metadata separate from clinical
metadata.  This can be done by creating a Study element with no Protocol,
StudyEventDef, or FormDef elements.  All the ItemGroupDefs would have
IsReferenceData=Yes.  Such a study would have no clinical data.

IsNull is a flag to signify that an item's value is to be set to null.
IsNull is used only under these conditions: Transaction type is 
Insert or Update or Upsert; the Value attribute is not supplied. In these
conditions, if IsNull is "Yes", then this is an instruction to set the
item's value to Null. If Value is specified, use it. 
If neither Value nor IsNull is set, do not change the item's value.
In the interest of creating non-verbose XML 
instances, one should not use ItemData elements with IsNull set to "Yes" to 
indicate uncollected data. The better practice is to transmit only 
collected data.

<p>
An electronic signature applies to a collection of clinical data.  This
indicates that some user accepts legal responsibility for that data.  See <a
href="http://www.fda.gov/ora/compliance_ref/part11/FRs/background/pt11finr.pdf">21 CRF Part 11</a>.  The signature identifies the person
signing, the location of signing, the signature meaning (via the referenced
SignatureDef), the date and time of signing, and (in the case of a digital
signature) an encrypted hash of the included data.

<p>An electronic signature applies to the entity to which it is attached
(typically a form).  The signature covers all clinical data in that entity
at the time of the signing, including all clinical data in any subentities.
Thus, a signature on a form includes all clinical data at the form, item
group, and item levels.

<p>For the purpose of this definition, clinical data includes all attributes
and element content <em>except</em> for TransactionType attributes,
Signature elements, and AuditRecord elements.

<p>Note:</b> Signatures apply to data at a particular point in time.  Signatures
cannot be modified.  However, new signatures can be applied when clinical
data changes.

<p>Note:</b> Signatures apply to the entire content of the <em>entity</em>, not
just the content that is mentioned in the current ODM <em>element</em>.
Signatures apply to (static) content, not to a change in content.

<p>Note:</b> The practice of initialing and dating changes on paper forms is a
way of maintaining an audit trail.  It should not be confused with 21 CFR
Part 11 electronic signatures (Signature elements).

<p>Note:</b> Contrast with <a href=#AuditRecord>AuditRecord</a>.

<p>
An AuditRecord carries information pertaining to the creation, deletion, or
modification of clinical data.  This information includes who performed that
action, and where, when, and why that action was performed.

<p>AuditRecord information describes a change to clinical data, but is not
itself clinical data.  The value of some clinical data can always be changed
by a subsequent transaction, but history cannot be changed -- only added to.

<p>AuditRecords are appropriate whenever an element has an TransactionType
(either explicit or inherited).  AuditRecords are not meaningful in Snapshot
transfers.

<p>Like the TransactionType attribute, AuditRecords are inherited by any
subelement that is allowed to have an AuditRecord and does not already have
an explicit one.

<p>Note:</b> Contrast with <a href=#Signature>Signature</a>.

<p><a name="enote2"><a href="#enote3"><font color=red>Editor's note:</b></font></a>The inheritance of AuditRecords, along with their placement at the
end of element bodies, implies the need for substantial lookahead in
processing ODM files.  We may wish to change this.
