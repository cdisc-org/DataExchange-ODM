This is version 2.0 of the Operational Data Model (ODM), which replaces version 1.3.2.  ODM version 2.0 is still under development.
The ODM 2.0 draft specification can be found at the CDISC Wiki: https://wiki.cdisc.org/display/ODM2/Operational+Data+Model+v2+Home

ODM is a vendor neutral, platform independent format for interchange and archive of clinical study data. The model includes the clinical data along with its associated metadata, administrative data, reference data and audit information. All of the information that needs to be shared among different software systems during the setup, operation, analysis, submission or for long term retention as part of an archive is included in the model.
